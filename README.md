# casual_food_mechanics
Starbound mod that disables food from rotting and makes it stackable up to **20**. Based on EclipticWulf's [Classic Food Mechanics](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/classic-food-mechanics.4719/).

### Installation
- Download latest version [here](https://github.com/Grabsky/casual_food_mechanics/releases/latest).

### Important Notes
- Max stack size changes are done via `buildfood.lua` file.  
- Rotting is disabled by removing contents of `rotting.lua` file.  
- If you happen to remove the mod, stack sizes will be back to normal, 'extra' items will be lost and remaining will start spoiling.

### Compatibility
- **Incompatible** with [Improved Food Descriptions](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/improved-food-descriptions.3743/).
